# Time series data Mining concepts 

- Discovers hidden temporal patterns(vectors of length Q)
- the fundamental TSDM concepts such as events,
- temporal patterns,
- event characterization function,
- temporal pattern cluster,
- time-delay embedding,
- phase space,
- augmented phase space,
- objective function, and optimization are defined and explained as is the TSDM
method for identifying temporal pattern clusters.
